# Getting Started

## Create flow (pipeline)

Here the flow almost means pipeline in CI area, but we think flow.ci should be more than CI.

### Steps to create flow
- Give a name
  * Click 'create flow' from left panel
  * Type a name for flow
  * The flow will be created directly without Git setup

- Git Setup (optional)
  * Git URL
  * SSH-RSA key
  * Test connection
 

 ## Setup YAML

By default, flow.ci will create a sample yaml after the flow created, of course you could change it from UI.

For more detail of YAML configuration please go to [YAML Configuration]() chapter
